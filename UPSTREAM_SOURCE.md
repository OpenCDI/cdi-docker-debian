All image derived from this repository is built on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).

But disclosing all licenses inside a container image is hard to be done, so commonly it seems to be enough to show main application (or middleware) license for a image.

In this project, a container image have a target GUI application which has single **FREE** license. Some application has libraries or plugins which are licensed under other one. Please check upstream announcement for them.

Following list should be meaningful to be compliant to licenses for each application from upstream, but delivered via debian community:
